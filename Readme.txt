## General Information
-A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market.
 The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
 For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 


The company wants to know:
 The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.
 You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the
 prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
 Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

 


Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and


How well those variables describe the price of a house.
